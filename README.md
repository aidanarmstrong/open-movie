# Open Movie 

The Open Source Streaming site for the less fortunate.

## Why Open Source

This project was thought to bring a group of talented developers 
together to create something amazing without profit or large greedy earnings
from big tech.

We decided that an Open Source streaming platform application could have a really
big impact on people who are far less fortunate than our community, 
as we have luxuries that we take for granted. 

A lot of people in the world do not have access to the internet, and a lot 
of people who do can not afford all the movie streaming sites that charge money per month 
which all add up to be quite expensive for the lower income households.


## What does open movie provide?
Open movie provides a streaming service film and television shows platform for
everyone around the world and especially the lower class income households.

During the 2020 global COVID19 pandemic I was distressed in cable and satellite 
televisions repeating the same films and tv shows through and still continue to repeat 
without the individuals being able to choose the shows or films that they want to choose.

That is why in May 2021 we decided to create open-movie.org the first real OpenSource
streaming platform designed to rid the lower income households of the forced to watch the
same thing over and over feeling like you are in a "groundhog day".

## How does it work?
Open movie is fully developed by developers all around the world with the 
idea to create something bigger than ourselves during the times of need.

Open movie is a free open source software as a service streaming site designed to be
help with the poverty in the world.
